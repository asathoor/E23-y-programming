# JSON data exchange

From the JSON Class


# inClass-json-intro.html

In this sample we've used a classical composer as a sample. Since the composer made more than one work, the works is a list (i.e. array). Note how the notation changed in the work list:

Here is the JSON that we made in the class:

~~~~
const composer = {
    name : "Wolfgang Amadeus",
    lastName : "Mozart",
    image : "moz.jpg",
    works : [
        "Zauberflöte",
        "Piano Trio No. 1 in B-flat major (Divertimento), K. 254 (1776)",
        "Piano Trio No. 2 in G major, K. 496 (1786)",
        "Piano Trio No. 3 in B-flat major, K. 502 (1786)",
        "String Quartet No. 5 in F major, K. 158 (1772–73)"
    ]
}
